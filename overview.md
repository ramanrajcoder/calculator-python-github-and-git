# Project Overview

## 1. Introduction
This project is a simple **console-based Calculator** built using **Python**.  
It performs the four basic arithmetic operations:

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)

The goal of this project is to understand:
- Python program structure
- Functions and user input
- Error handling
- Building small CLI applications
- Using Git & GitHub for version control

---

## 2. Project Objective
The main objective is to create a functional calculator that:
- Accepts input from the user
- Performs mathematical operations
- Displays correct results
- Handles invalid inputs and division-by-zero errors gracefully

This calculator demonstrates beginner-level programming skills and is ideal for learning or academic mini-projects.

## 3. Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Visual Studio Code** (for development)
- **Git** (for version control)
- **GitHub** (for hosting the repository)

## 4. Core Features
- Add two numbers  
- Subtract two numbers  
- Multiply two numbers  
- Divide two numbers  
- Prevent division by zero  
- Easy loop-based menu system for repeated calculations

## 5. Why This Project?
This project helps in understanding:
- Function creation in Python
- Conditional statements
- Loops (while)
- Basic error handling using `try-except`
- Clean, modular coding practices
- Git commits and repository structure

It is simple, but covers all the fundamentals required in development workflows.

## 6. Expected Output
A clean, functional calculator that runs inside the terminal and performs operations until the user chooses to exit.
